<p style="font-size: 20px"> At Kenya Ports Authority, we understand the role the maritime and shipping industry plays, as a critical cog that fuels the growth of our economies through movement of bulk cargo by sea. Kenya Ports Authority is a wholly owned State Corporation established through an Act of Parliament in January 1978. KPA is mandated to manage and operate all scheduled seaports along Kenya’s coastline and Inland waterways. This includes Mombasa, Lamu, Kisumu, Malindi, Kilifi, Mtwapa, Kiunga, Shimoni, Funzi and Vanga. KPA also manages the Inland Container Depots in Nairobi and Naivasha.

History

The KPA was established in 1978 through an act of Parliament.[5][6]
Overview

Kenya Ports Authority is an investor in Kenya National Shipping Line, a state corporation of Kenya formed in 1989, currently owned by KPA and three non-Kenyan corporate investos.[7]

In 1989, the government of Kenya brought together the operation and regulation of existing ferry services, including the Likoni Ferry service at Likoni, Mombasa, into one subsidiary of the KPA, Kenya Ferry Services. The subsidiary was devolved to the status of an independent Kenya state corporation in 1998, 20 percent owned by KPA and 80 percent owned by other Kenyan Government entities.[8]

KPA also owns various sports teams, including Kenyan Premier League team Bandari FC and a leading basketball club.[9]

In August 2014, Kenya Ports Authority signed a deal worth US$478 million with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) for the construction of three Port Lamu berths. The three new berths will form part of the US$24 billion Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) and take Port Lamu's berth count to 32 upon completion.[10][11]
